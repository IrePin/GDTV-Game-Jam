It is responsible for managing the game state, handling game events, and coordinating different game systems. Here's an example of a basic game manager script:\n\n\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class GameManager : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public static GameManager instance;\n\n    private bool isGameOver = false;\n\n    private void Awake()\n    {\n        if (instance == null)\n        {\n            instance = this;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Destroy(gameObject);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void GameOver()\n    {\n        isGameOver = true;\n        // Add code to handle game over event\n    }\n\n    public bool IsGameOver()\n    {\n        return isGameOver;\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn this script, we define a GameManager class that inherits from the MonoBehaviour class. We also define a static instance of the GameManager class, which allows us to access the GameManager from other scripts.\n\nThe Awake() method is called when the script is first loaded. In this method, we check if an instance of the GameManager already exists. If it does not exist, we set the instance to this script. If it does exist, we destroy this script to ensure that there is only one instance of the GameManager in the game.\n\nThe GameOver() method is called when the game is over. In this method, we set the isGameOver variable to true and add code to handle the game over event.\n\nThe IsGameOver() method is a getter method that returns the value of the isGameOver variable.\n\nYou can add more functionality to this script as needed, such as handling game start events, managing game score, or controlling game difficulty."
